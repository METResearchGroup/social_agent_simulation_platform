# After Screenshots

Captured after implementing the View Agents feature.

- `view_runs_toggle.png`: View runs | View agents toggle at top-left, with "View runs" active. Sidebar shows Run History and Start New Run.
- `view_agents_mode.png`: "View agents" active. Sidebar shows Agents heading; main area shows error/retry when API returns 401 (auth required). With valid auth, agent list and AgentDetail would render.
