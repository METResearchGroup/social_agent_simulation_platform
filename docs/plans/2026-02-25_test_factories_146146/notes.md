# Issue #146 — Unified test factories

This folder stores verification artifacts for the factories migration:

- `model_inventory_after_pull.txt`: inventory of generated/persisted action model types after pulling latest `main`.
- `rg_counts_before.txt`: constructor boilerplate counts before migration.
- `rg_counts_after.txt`: constructor boilerplate counts after migration (filled after implementation).
