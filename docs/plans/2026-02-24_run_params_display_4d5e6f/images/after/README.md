# After (Part 4)

Run Parameters block shows: Agents, Turns, Algorithm, Algorithm Config (if any), and **Metrics** (selected metric keys as chips). When run details are loading, the block shows "Loading run config…". When run details fail, the block shows "Could not load run config" with a Retry button.

Capture: Select a run that has metric_keys (e.g. one started with the metrics selector); open run detail and a turn view; screenshot the Run Parameters section with the Metrics row (chips).
