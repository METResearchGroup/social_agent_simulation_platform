# Rules for the repo

1. Interfaces live next to implementations, in a "(path to folder)/interfaces.py" (e.g., feeds/interfaces.py).
2. Prefer ABC to Protocol, for strict inheritance and enforcement at runtime.

Dependency Injection over concrete instantiation

- Services should not instantiate concrete infra/state dependencies internally (e.g., no InMemory...() inside business methods).
- Inject dependencies via constructor or builder functions.

Keep orchestration thin

- Facades like SimulationEngine should delegate; avoid embedding dependency-construction logic in orchestration classes when possible.
